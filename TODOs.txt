TODO:
Barrel calculation socket location?? ///What happened to this EP138
Barrel movement when shooting
AutoAim ability for player upon locking on target + Move to PlayerAimingComponent
DAMPING continues through the air
NavigatonMesh needs fixing. AI tanks take too optimistic path and last added AI tank does not move at start. Needs jumpStart to start moving??
Tank movement physics
Shaking ground and barrel. Maybe barrel problem?
Projectile collides with barrel when firing in forward moving tank! Projectiles are also too fast to not pass though objects without hit event
Despawn projectiles and only make them explode once xd
Tank particle effects could be nicer. Needs adjustment to size and time active
Tank smoke particle has a gap shortly after firing?
Tank projectile PlayerDamage should decrease with distance
AI looks for controllers other than just player.
Bad fps when depossessing PlayerTank. Could be HealthBars or GroundShaking
PlayerUI could use more information
Game a bit too hard :D
